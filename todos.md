## big

* add facebook support
    * make this a facebook app. it uses your facebook friends and then when you're done, it publishes a cool graphic to your timeline (and directs other people to make their own and links them). I showed it to some friends and they had a lot of fun playing it but wanted something to do with it when they were done, specifically posting a graphic to their timeline. You should be able to tweet it or instagram it too.
    * and like make a cool lonely sandwich style promo vid showing some people hanging out and playing it. kinda funny and short.
    * maybe it would be more viral if it was smaller? Like, the game is you make one of these for EACH of your facebook friends and post it to their timeline. Instead of "cast your life" it'd be more like, "hey friend, IMO this is your celebrity lookalike". It's easier to imagine what the image/graphic would look like if there's only two side-by-side photos. And it could be scattered all over facebook with links pointing back to our site / app (which can have an ad or two on it)
* unique urls / permalinks
    * zealously generate and redirect upon visit to top-level URL
    * allow forking in place
    * editable through one-time socket connection ONLY
        * live broadcasts to other viewers


## small

* re-size the indicator
    * what indicator?
        * the loading indicator
        * actually, loading should eventually be indicated more precisely

## style

* come up with a visual style for the whole thing and make it happen
* i kinda want to try this
* I'm curious about how developers and designers share responsibilities. Like, if I were the designer and you were the developer, would I ask you to structure the divs in a certain way and give you class names and then get to work? or would i go in and do that?
    * I don't know, but however you feel like doing it, just go for it
