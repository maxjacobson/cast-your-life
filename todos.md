## big

* add the couch db
* add facebook support
* make this a facebook app. it uses your facebook friends and then when you're done, it publishes a cool graphic to your timeline (and directs other people to make their own and links them). I showed it to some friends and they had a lot of fun playing it but wanted something to do with it when they were done, specifically posting a graphic to their timeline. You should be able to tweet it or instagram it too.

## small

* re-size the indicator
* add tmdb attribution (we did agree to it)
